    <h1>Reading Reflection #1</h1>

    <p>
      I think about image making as something that affects how we see and understand the world around us. Images are everywhere, and we often don’t stop to think about how much they influence our memories and opinions. In <em>In Plato’s Cave</em>, Susan Sontag talks about how photography turns moments into something we can keep, share, and look at again later. Reading this made me realize how normal it feels today to constantly take and view images. For me, creating images and graphics is not just about making something look nice, but about choosing what moments matter and how they are presented.

      Susan Sontag explains that taking photographs can feel like a way of controlling or understanding reality. When we take a picture, we decide what to include and what to leave out, which already changes the meaning of the moment. This idea feels especially relevant today, when images are constantly shared online. We scroll through photos without knowing the full story behind them, yet those images still shape how we think about people, events, and even ourselves. Photography and image making can make things feel closer, but they can also create distance, turning real experiences into something we observe rather than fully live.

      As a first-year student in Emerging Media, I’m really interested in graphic design, web design, and UI/UX. I like thinking about how people interact with images and websites, not just how they look. For me, design isn’t only about making things pretty—it’s about creating something that feels easy to use, clear, and meaningful. When I work on a project, I think about how someone else will experience it, how they’ll move through it, and what they’ll notice first. It feels exciting to combine creativity with problem-solving and to make something that people can actually interact with.

      I like combining photography, graphics, and text to tell stories or show ideas. Images can capture a moment, a feeling, or an idea, and words can add context or meaning. Together, they can explain things that a single image or sentence might not. Right now, our world feels fast and complicated, and I try to show that through my work—small details, colors, layouts, or captions that make people pause and notice something they might normally miss. Whether it’s a photo, an illustration, or a mix of both, I want my work to make people think, feel, or see familiar things in a new way.

      Even though this course has just started, I can already see how each project will help me learn new skills and ways of thinking about media. I’m excited to try different types of assignments, from photography to web design to graphics, and see how they connect. I know that each project will teach me something new, and I hope to use those lessons in the next one. It feels motivating to start building a foundation for my creative voice and see how small experiments can grow over time.

      For me, image making is more than just creating visuals—it’s a way to explore ideas and share how I see the world. Even at the beginning of this course, I feel excited to experiment and learn new ways to communicate through design, photography, and graphics. I want my work to be clear, meaningful, and something that others can connect with. I hope that as I continue with this class, I can keep improving my skills, discovering my style, and making work that reflects both my perspective and the world around me.
