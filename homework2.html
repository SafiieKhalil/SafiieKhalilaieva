  <h1>Homework 2: Reflection on Photography and Photoshop</h1>

    <p>For this assignment, I selected two photographs that, in my opinion, best embodied the compositional principles covered in the lectures. The main goal was to understand how framing, framing, and lighting can enhance visual interest and emotion in an image.</p>
    </p>The first photograph (Image A, 1920x1080) was shot using the rule of thirds and leading lines. I positioned the main subject off-center, closer to the intersection of the lines, to allow the viewer's eye to naturally move through the image. I also left space around the subject in the frame, creating balance and direction, with the horizon line directing attention to the key element. When cropping, I adapted the image to the 1920x1080 pixel format, maintaining compositional tension, and then adjusted the levels and curves to improve contrast and enhance color saturation.</p>
    </p>The second photograph (Image B, 5x7 inches) was vertical. Here, I experimented with negative space and depth to highlight the main subject and create the illusion of space. Cropping helped focus attention on the subject, and tonal adjustments made the image more dynamic and expressive.</p>
    </p>Working with Photoshop showed me the importance of using non-destructive editing so I could adjust light and contrast without losing quality. Exporting to JPEG for the web taught me how to consider file sizes while maintaining visual quality.</p>
    </p>Overall, this project helped me better understand composition, framing, and working with tonal range, and helped me combine creative intent with technical image processing skills.</p>
