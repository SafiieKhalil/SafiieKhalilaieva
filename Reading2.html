    <h1>Reading Reflection #2</h1>

    <p>
In the article “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster”, Nesrine Malik discusses how artificial intelligence is changing the way we see and understand the world. She calls it “AI slop,” meaning the messy, false, or misleading information AI can create, which affects our perception of reality. Basically, she warns that we are losing the ability to tell what is true and what is false, and this could lead to serious problems in society.

I think Malik makes a very important point. Today, people trust technology more and more without thinking about the risks. AI can produce information that looks believable but is completely wrong. We see this already with fake news, deepfake videos, and altered images. The problem is that many people do not check sources and automatically believe what they see online. This is dangerous because it changes how we understand events and can even influence big decisions, like elections, public debates, or personal choices.    </p>

Another point I found important is what Malik says about society “sleepwalking” into disaster. It feels like we are walking on a path full of traps, but we do not notice them. Social media and technology can create a false sense of reality. Algorithms decide what we see, often only showing us things that match our opinions or interests. This makes it even harder to see the full picture. If we do not think critically and rely on trustworthy sources, we risk losing the ability to distinguish truth from lies.

The article also reminds me that technology itself is not bad. AI can be very useful in medicine, science, and education. It can help people solve problems faster and make life easier. But when AI starts replacing facts with false information, it becomes dangerous. Beautiful images, convincing text, or realistic videos do not always mean something is true. People need to remember this, especially when making important decisions.

Malik’s article made me think about my own use of technology. It is easy to trust what we see on a screen and forget to question it. I realize that I should check sources, read critically, and not blindly accept information generated by AI. The article shows that staying alert and aware is necessary to avoid being misled.
    </p>

    <p>
Overall, the main message of the article is that society needs to be careful in the digital age. We cannot let AI decide what is real for us. We must use technology as a tool, not a replacement for thinking. Critical thinking, source checking, and skepticism are important skills to develop in today’s world. Only then can we use technology safely and avoid the “sleepwalking” into disaster that Malik warns about.

    </p>
For me, the article is a clear reminder that while AI and technology can help people in many ways, we must take responsibility for how we interact with them. Awareness, caution, and education are essential. Technology should serve us, not control our understanding of reality.
